# -Image-Mosaicking

iven two or three pictures of a scene taken by rotating the camera about a vertical axis, transform the images and joint them to form a mosaic. The images must have some significant degree of overlap. A good overlap region is at least 50% of the object being observed. This is a mosaicking problem. Here, you can also detect the corresponding points manually.
